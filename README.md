# CIS_451
Projects from the OS class

Okay, so haven't bothered to use version control too much in the past.
Looking to make it something of a habit now, so going to make a real
strong effort to keep this stuff organized and decent looking.

The files in this repository are ultimately going to be two things: a C program that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes and a Python program that simulates an operating system loader.

The Python program will include test files and will be developed over numerous commits.
